# Distributed_Computing
This is a distributed computing project using Dask to analyse a dataset of papers about Covid-19. 

It was the final project of the course of MAPD-B (Management and Analysis of Physical Datasets - Module B)

The file MAPD_text contains the project proposal.

The ipynb file contains our solution using Dask on a 3 virtual machinescluster.

An extra task was added to the end of the work:
-Use Dask to generate and Display the network of the colaborations between authors on a map-reduce fashion.
-Use Dask to compute the degree centrality of the nodes of the Network on a map-reduce fashion.
